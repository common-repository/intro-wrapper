Wrap your intro text in a DIV element with the class "intro"

== Description ==

This plugin takes care of wrapping your intro text (everything before &lt;!--more--&gt; -- also called "teaser content") in a div element with the class "intro". 

This allows for easy styling of the intro text, e.g. with larger fonts, colors, etc.


== Installation ==
1. Download and unzip plugin
2. Upload the 'intro-wrapper' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory,
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed the plugin, but can't see any difference =
The difference is only in the outputted HTML. You must add styling of the intro class yourself.

= Where do I add the styling? =
Try style.css.

= The styling i added was lost when I upgraded my theme =
This has nothing to do with the plugin. You're doing things the wrong way. Read this: http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes
